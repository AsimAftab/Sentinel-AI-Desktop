# Integration Layer Dependencies
#
# This file intentionally left empty!
#
# The integration layer uses ONLY Python standard library:
# - threading (built-in)
# - queue (built-in)
# - sys (built-in)
# - os (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in)
# - signal (built-in)
# - atexit (built-in)
# - dataclasses (built-in, Python 3.7+)
# - enum (built-in)
# - datetime (built-in)
#
# NO EXTERNAL PACKAGES REQUIRED FOR THE LAUNCHER!
#
# The launcher simply orchestrates your existing backend and frontend,
# which already have their own dependencies installed.
