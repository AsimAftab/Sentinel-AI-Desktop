# Sentinel AI Unified Launcher - Root Requirements
#
# This file intentionally left empty!
#
# The launcher itself has ZERO external dependencies.
# It uses only Python's standard library.
#
# Dependencies are managed separately in each component:
# - Sentinel-AI-Backend/requirements.txt (294 packages for ML/AI backend)
# - Sentinel-AI-Frontend/requirements.txt (11 packages for PyQt5 frontend)
#
# To install component dependencies:
#   cd Sentinel-AI-Backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
#   cd Sentinel-AI-Frontend && pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or use the automated installer:
#   python setup_launcher.py
#
# But if your backend and frontend already work individually,
# you don't need to install anything new - just run:
#   python launcher.py
